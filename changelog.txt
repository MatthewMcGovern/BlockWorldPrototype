ADDED:
- BaseEntityAI class
- Man model is back in
- Path finding
-- It's some form of A* but still checking every possible square so potentially expensive (it's not too bad so far).
- Some very basic "Job" code as a proof of concept (to control A.I via jobs)
-- It's very buggy at the moment

ISSUES:
- Something funny happens with the pathfinding when it paths too close to the target
-- It takes a less optimal route by going diagonal then towards it...
-- It sometimes even travels to the same node twice so it just sits there for a tick.
--- These are most likely related to the way the path gets merged once a connection is found, as you add the goal node and the start node where the meeting occured.
- JobCode is massively out of sync, causes the AI to try to harvest non-existant entitys!

ADDED:
- A log!
- Trees now harvest into a log
- Updated EntityContainer to have deferred adding/removing to avoid wrecking the list during an update.
- Entity schematics now have descriptions... Not sure why. Just wanted to add a personal touch

CHANGES:
- Render offset moved to schematic

ISSUES:
- Have to scale the log to about 0.1 of its size, for some reason it is HUGE even though it shouldn't be.

NOTES:
- A.I is non existant (again, again).

Date: 02/09/2013

ADDED:
- Rewrote the engine (well copy pasted all the good bits to a new organised project)
- Basic behaviour code
- Can set/get types of behaviour on the entity schematic.
- Added entity container to manage all entities

NOTES:
- Items are now Entitys

Date: 01/09/2013

ADDED:
- Reworked the Items code
-- More streamlined adding/removing of items
-- Using SegmentLocations now instead of x/y/z
-- Harvestable Items (needs reworking or I'm going to have a ton of base classes

NOTES:
- Was out most of the day

ADDED:
- Basic AI
- AI Manager
- Pathfinding (very inefficient path flooding)

NOTES:
- Not sure what else... I think I played Monster Hunter instead.

Date: 30/08/2013

ADDED:
- Change log
- Debug log ingame
-- Static so it can be called from anywhere
-- Has multiple message types
- Ramp blocks top/bottom
-- combines/obscures vertices like cubes
- Started the editor

FIXES:
- Fixed bottom ramps textures pointing the wrong way.

TODO:
- Finish the editor, but first:
- Add a "World" wrapper so I can access the frigging effect files rather than making a copy all over the place -_-
- Drawable complex components need a "draw model" mode and a "draw cubeworld" mode as they vary.

Date: The Past

ADDED:
- SegmentManager
-- Segments
--- Render Segments
--- Item cotainers!
---- Items
----- Render basic
- Block Masks

NOTES:
Cubes only draw visible vertices.
Render chunks are only updated when a face changes, this way cubes can be recalculated without hindering performance!
